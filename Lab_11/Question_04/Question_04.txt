In Java, a server can handle multiple clients without blocking by using threads. Each client connection is handled in its own thread, allowing the server to process multiple connections concurrently. The main server thread continuously listens for new client connections using (accept) command, and when a connection is established, it delegates communication with that client to a separate thread. This approach ensures that a slow or unresponsive client does not block the server from accepting or communicating with other clients, enabling efficient and scalable multitasking.
